# React Meetups

React Meetups App is a demo project created using ***NextJS*** and ***React***. The application displays a list of meetups available along with their details, such as the their location, and description. The user can also add new meetups to the list using a simple form. The app uses ***MongoDB*** as a database to store the meetup data.

The application is built with a modern and scalable architecture using NextJS, which allows for fast and responsive rendering of the application along with its core feature like server-side rendering and simplified file based routing. React is used to create the user interface, which is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. The MongoDB database is used to store and retrieve data, allowing for efficient data management.

This Meetups App is a great example of how to build a full-stack application using modern technologies. It can be used as a reference project for developers who are looking to build similar applications.
